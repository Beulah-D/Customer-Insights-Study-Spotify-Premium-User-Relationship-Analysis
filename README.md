# Customer Insights Study Spotify Premium User Relationship Analysis
Project Overview
Conducted a 60-minute in-depth qualitative interview as part of MKT 512 (Customer Insights & Analytics) to analyze the evolving relationship between a daily Spotify Premium user and the platform.
This assignment focused on understanding not just usage behavior, but the emotional, functional, and social dimensions of a continuous service relationship

### What I Did: 

- Designed a structured discussion guide based on relationship marketing frameworks
- Conducted and recorded a depth interview using storytelling and brand personification techniques
- Mapped the customer journey across discovery, constraint, and habitual use phases
- Identified critical relationship-shaping incidents (e.g., ad-triggered upgrade, collaborative playlist reinforcement, algorithm fatigue)
- Extracted emotional drivers, friction points, and switching risks
- Translated qualitative insights into strategic retention recommendations

### Key Insights: 

- Spotify functions as a comfort companion, not just a streaming utility.
- Social features (collaborative playlists) significantly increase lock-in.
- Repetitive recommendations and interface clutter are emerging retention risks.
- Loyalty is strong but conditional — price and improved discovery could trigger switching.
