Project Overview
Conducted a 60-minute in-depth qualitative interview as part of MKT 512 (Customer Insights & Analytics) to analyze the evolving relationship between a daily Spotify Premium user and the platform.

- Designed a structured discussion guide based on relationship marketing frameworks

### Key Insights: 

- Spotify functions as a comfort companion, not just a streaming utility.
